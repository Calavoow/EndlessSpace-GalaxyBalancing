Requirements
-------------

OS: Windows XP\2003\Vista\Windows7 or any server variant of same.

Runtimes: The tool requires you have the Microsoft.Net 4.0 runtimes installed on your system, it is highly unlikey
to work with earlier .net runtime version.  If you don't have the 4.0 runtimes on your system you can insall them
from microsoft here:

4.0 Full Runtimes link -> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa569263.aspx

(if you wany a slightly striped down version that this app will work with you can try this link ->
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=24872
)


The tool should run fine in a virtual environment.it was built in one.

Installation
------------
1. Install the MS.Net 4.0 runtimes if you don't already have them.
2. Unzip the folder anywhere you like and you're done, 


Assumptions: The tool assumes Steam is installed on the system it's running on, or more specifically 
the following key exits. HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Valve\Steam\SteamPath. 
It uses this to build a path to find the ES English localization file, If you don't have steam or ES installed
on the system your useing that's ok as long as you dummy up the folder structure as if you did.  
Ie create the steam path key and dummy up the folder structure. Example
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Valve\Steam]
"SteamPath"="c:/temp/games/steam"
Then under c:\temp\games\steam create the "\steamapps\common\endless space\Public\Localization\english" sub folders
and place a copy of your localization file in there.
I've included the dummy structure and a regkey in the steamdummy.zip file in this package.

The tool also assumes you have an "\Endless Space\Save" folder in your profile folder, again if you don't have
the game installed please dummy that up as needed, as the tool will likely bomb (nicely though) when going to
save without it. Some day I'll get around to making these two issues go away with configurable options.

Lastly the app assumes it can write to the \ESEditor subfolder whereever the tool was unzipped too when it
needs to work with temporary copies of files, as well as having access to the folders mentioned above. 


Starting and using the tool
----------------------------
Double click the ESMapEditor.exe file.

Use the File menu to either load a game file or save a file you are editing.
The Save buttons and Exit button on the main form duplicate the file\save and file\exit menu options
they are there just for convenience.
Once you load a file you can really only do the following at the moment:
1.Edit system locations using the show map feature or manual chages.
2.On the Empires tab you can see each player empire’s descriptors, techs and tech elements, 
(sorry no editing just yet.), but you can set the dust amount for any player.

3.* But dont do this* edit warp and constellation and stat entreies using the GameInfoDBG tab. I'm just explaining it's
technically possible for those that know what they are looking at in the datagrid. I'm looking to add an interface
for doing things like that a later date in safe(er) way.

Accessing and using the map screen:
Once a file is loaded...
Select a system from the drop down box on the lower left, you should see it load that system’s
Information to the tab below. The Human player's home system should be shown by default.
Press the Show Map button and it will load a map screen with the currently selected system shown as a red planet,
your(player0's) home system marked as a blue earth like Planet and all other star systems show as barren like moons.
If your home planet is the selected planet it will show as red.

Map screen
-----------
Here you can click on a star system to see the basic information about it in a tooltip popup.
To enable a system to be moved, double click on it.
To disable a system from being enabled for movement double click it again. (or release the mouse key while CTRL - dragging it.
To move a system after it’s been enabled for movement hold down CTRL and your Left mouse button key and move the mouse.
You should see the planet jump and start to follow your mouse. Upon releasing your Left mouse button while ctrl
is still down will release\set the system to it’s current location. It doesn't matter if your mouse is directly over
the system when moving or not, where you see the planet icon is where the system is located at. Also be aware
it's not a great idea to move it around in cicles very fast, it'll probably pain your cpu, cause for every mouse move
while the system is being moved there are lots of things being done in the background beyond just repainting the screen.

Changing the scale:
You may notice the map is too small (systems all clumped together), if that's the case you can grab the corner of
the map screen and make it larger, then change the scale above from 4 to say 5 or 6 and then press REFRESH.
That *should* scale the map larger to the larger form size.  I've done nearly my best at getting the scaling stuff
to work, bottomline then if on this screen two planets at 4.0 scale are nearly on top of one another then they are
about an inch or so appart inside the game (ie really close).

Warps\Constellations\Wormholes options:
You check or uncheck these options to disable\enable the drawing of the Warp\CosmicString lines (Green), the
Wormhole lines (Red), or the ConstellationID #'s (Yellow).

AutoUpdate option:
So normally the intended (default assumption) use of the map screen is for you to have selected a system on the 
main screen then going to the map screen to change that particular system's location. If you end up updaing 
muliple systems while on the map screen while those changes have been temporarly saved you'll need to go back
to the main screen and select each and every planet you modified and clikc "update" - this actually marks your
current changes to be saved vs. just showing you updated values. In fact the need to press updated in most cases
is highlight by some green text near the update button if needed but I digress.  Basically if you move around more
then a couple systems it can be a pain in the ass to go back and press "update" for each of them, assuming you can
even remember which they were.  If you enable this option, you don't have to do that, every time you move a system
it not only moved in temporary sense but the changes is actually saved as if you pressed update.  

Why not just do that by default? Safety, you may end up touching systems you really didn't want or intend to move,
without this option on if you save the file without first pressing 'update' for those systems you don't have to 
worry about those unintended changes being saved.

That's about it most anything else should be self explainitory I think or has a tooltip.

Features disabled in this version:
StarSystemType changing with proper statistics update.  You can change the value but the stats don't get updated.
If you don't know what that means don't change a StarSystemType then. ;)
