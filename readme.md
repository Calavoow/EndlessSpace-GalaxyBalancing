Balanced Galaxy Generation Mod
=======================

The goal of this mod is to find a simple solution so that a reasonably balanced galaxy can be generated.

###Current Approach
The current approach is to calculate a certain score for each player and then apply balancing on the result.
This could be in the form of adjust a few planets in the neighbourhood of a player to the regeneration of a
new galaxy till a balanced galaxy is generated.
